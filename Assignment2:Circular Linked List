/*[Question. 1] While traversing a single-circular linked list  which condition establishes that the traversing 
    element/variable has reached the first element? */
//[Ans.1]
// Lets take an exaple and create a basic circular linked list  
# include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Creating Node class
class Node{
  //Creating class objects
  public:
  int data;
  Node*next;
  //Calling Node constructor    
  Node(int data){
    this->data=data;
    next=NULL;
  }
};
//Function to insert naode at the end of the linked list
void append(Node*&head,int data){
    Node*temp=head;
    Node*new node=new Node(data);
    if(temp==NULL){head=new_node;new_node->next=head;return;}
    while(temp->next!=head){temp=temp->next;}//This condition establishes that the traversing element(temp) has reached the first element
    temp->next=new_node;
    new_node->next=head;
}
//Funtion to print elements of the linked list from head to the last node.
void pfun(Nod&head){
    Node*temp=head;
    do{cout<<temp->data<<"->";temp=temp->next;}
    while(temp!=head);
}

int main(){
    Node*head=NULL;
    append(head,1);
    append(head,2);
    append(head,3);
    pfun(head);
}
/*
With reference to above example off the circular linke  list.
List 24 i.e. while(temp->next!=head){temp=temp->next;} establishes that the traversing element/variable has reached at the first element.
We know that in circular linked list last node of the linked list points to the head of the linked list, hence we can check if any node
 points to head of linked list then that node is the end of the circular linked list.

/*[Question. 2] What are the practical application of circular linked list?(Try to find applications in your respective fields)

Practical applications of circular linked list are:
1) Multiplayer Games: All the players are kept in circular Linked list and the pointer keeps on moving forward as a player's chance ends.
2) Computing resources: Circular linked list is used to manage the computing resources of the computer.
3) Fibonacci Heap: Circular linked list is also used in the implementation of advanced data structures such as Fibonacci Heap'
4) Computer Networking: Circular list also used in the computer networking for token scheduling.
5) Implementation of Data Structure: Data structures such as stacks and queues are implemented with the help of the circular linked lists.
6) Audio/Video Streaming: Circular linked list is also used in audio and video streaming, for example, when one person complete audio list 
 finishes playing in music player then it again starts playing from the start.
